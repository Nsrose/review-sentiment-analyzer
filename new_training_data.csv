"Facebook just took a massive step towards making tech hiring more fair.

Our top rotational program, which gets tens of thousands of applications, will no longer accept referrals.

This means candidates who don’t know someone already working at Facebook won’t be at an unfair disadvantage in the application process.

The biggest obstacle to diversity in tech is diverse candidates often lack the referrals necessary to get their foot in the door.

Every applicant deserves equal consideration and resume evaluation, regardless of their connections!

Incredibly proud that Facebook is being the first major tech company to do this and hope other companies follow suit.

"Education should be a basic human right, but in many parts of the world that’s simply not the case.

This Giving Tuesday, if you have the means, I hope you will consider donating to enable education for children who otherwise won’t have access to it.

There’s a nonprofit I support called Asha for Education that led the development of over 160 schools across 22 states of India last year alone and improved the lives of over 219,000 children. I’ll link it below for anyone interested in donating. Facebook is currently matching all donations made!

For every reshare of this post, I’ll also donate $5 to Asha (for the first 100 reshares). Please consider donating or sharing this wonderful organization with your network to help enable equal access to education for kids who need it the most.

"Our Fact #30 for #FactFriday - intracranial pressure (ICP)
For many diseases of the brain, it is necessary to measure the pressure inside the skull. This pressure is called intracranial pressure (ICP). Broadly speaking, there are three components inside the skull: Brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid and vessels/blood. If the volume of one of these components increases, the ICP will change. This is the case in acute hydrocephalus, but also tumors and brain haemorrhages can disrupt the balance between the three components and result in an increased ICP. ICP is currently measured with different invasive systems, each with their own characteristics and challenges. The measurement of ICP is in itself only a monitoring-tool, which, if necessary, has to be combined with ICP regulating measures.",0

"Today I graduate top 1.5% of my class at San Francisco State University with a B.S. in Business Administration; double concentration in Information Systems and Marketing as a first-generation Filipino American! 🇵🇭

After transferring from City College of San Francisco of December 2019, I cannot believe my undergrad came quick!

Here are a few notable things I have learned from my undergrad:
🎓 Take the risk! ~ Whether it is joining an organization, striking a conversation with a person in class, or picking up a new hobby - college is too short to doubt yourself and contemplate if anything is for you. You will never be fully prepared for what is ahead, so go try it and give it your all!

🎓 It is not all about the grade! ~ 120 units is a lot to complete. Your upper-division classes can even be more difficult. While keeping up your grades and getting that “A” is ideal, what matters the most is if you are learning from your classes! A grade is a grade at the end of the day, but what you take away from each class can bring even a greater difference to your career. So stay passionate and engaged in the material; ironically, the grade follows!

🎓 Study hard, but care for yourself harder! ~ It is inevitable to have 3 exams, a 10-page paper, and a group project all due on the same day or week. While work like this can quickly become overwhelming, taking care of yourself becomes more of a priority. Your body needs rest and energy to function. Drinking water, eating a snack, taking a quick power nap or sleeping early can go a long way. We are not built to work 24/7, so breathe! Everything will work out ❤️

And just a blink of an eye, that wraps up undergrad! I hope to continue to learn and stay curious beyond education. There are more places to explore, people to meet, and lessons to be learned! So bring it! ☺️🤓

__
Here are a few notable achievements I have accomplished throughout my undergrad:
✨ Marketing Department Honoree of 2022
✨ Top 10 Information Systems Undergraduate of 2022
✨ CIO Scholar of 2021
✨ Cofounder, VP and President of Gator LinkedIn Group from 2020-2022
✨ VP of Marketing of Psi Kappa, Alpha Kappa Psi of 2022

Special thanks to my family, friends, and Professors who I have met to whom I attribute my knowledge :)

"Heartbroken to share that my older sister, Katherine, 37, passed away yesterday morning after battling cancer for over a year.

She spent the last 6 weeks bingeing on local viet and el jannahs - her favourite, strolling through Bondi beach with Laurence, and of course, spending long due time with parents. 2 years in lockdown, forgotten.

She was so peaceful when I saw her. Kat fought hard, until the very end. Mum by her side, hands firmly gripped. She was finally home, finally safe. Finally.

Kat was my world; she was much more to many.

Penny for my thought? Make the most of every moment, times are fleeting, and never discount family. For now, I'll be off-grid and in auto-pilot to get things in order.

Funeral details tbc, sometime this weekend.

Bye je.

"Today I was laid off by Coinbase. It was shocking to say the least, and it didn’t fully hit me until reading messages from close friends and coworkers that this journey has come to an end. It’s difficult to not micro-analyze the situation, but looking back at my 1.5 years at Coinbase, I truly feel proud of my work and how much I grew as a person. I hope those who were impacted today feel the same. Layoffs don’t reflect who we are nor our competence; it’s a byproduct of the macroeconomy. 

The most challenging part of today was not being able to say goodbye to the wonderful people I work with. If you are reading this, know that I am so grateful we got to work together. You challenged me to be more innovative and uplifted me in ways you can’t imagine. 

What’s next? I’m searching for my next career opportunity! If you know people who are recruiting for Biz Ops & Strategy, Product Operations, Consulting, Product Management, Venture Capital, Program Management, or anything else that might be a good fit, please let me know! I’m open to different opportunities and would love to learn more. 

It’s been a wild ride here. On to the next one!

"Never done this kind of post before but really need help spreading the word... Earlier this year my incredible wife Megan Colford was diagnosed with a rare blood disease that affects fewer than one in one million people, for which the only complete cure is a bone marrow transplant. 

When we first found out, we had countless friends offer to donate their bone marrow. But unfortunately it doesn’t work that way. The odds of anyone in our circle being a perfect match for Megan in particular, aside from her siblings, was very low. But the chances that those people who volunteered are a match for someone out there who needs a bone marrow transplant are much higher, and becoming a bone marrow donor means giving someone else a shot at a transplant and a second lease on life. It's a super simple process that takes only a few minutes at Be The Match - they send you a swab at home and voila you're on the registry! (https://lnkd.in/gHMD4wdy). Alternatively, you can give blood to your local American Red Cross blood bank (you can find the one nearest to you here: https://lnkd.in/gn4JyCxn). Megan received several life-saving blood transfusions in the lead-up to the transplant, and will receive more as she continues to recover.

After a successful transplant and 30 days in the hospital, we headed home today. We were lucky that her brother was a perfect match, but for most people BeTheMatch is their only hope. If you're willing to help spread the word, share this post and save a life. #bethematch Stanford Hospitals & Clinics",0
"I’ll rip the band-aid right off: I just left #Google! As with any big decision, this is something I've pondered over a period of time and as I’ve seen several people join the “Great Resignation” over the past couple of years, I always felt a slight tinge of envy, but never realized that when I did the same, it would bring so many emotions to the surface. I dropped off my badge and laptop just an hour ago (obligatory pic attached) and that was the moment when it felt real. Almost too real. 

I feel immense pride at having built the things I helped build and also a lifetime of gratitude for having had the opportunity to learn from the best and brightest people on the planet, but talking about my Google experience via the work I did would be like describing an iceberg by its tip. I joined over 9 years ago with a faint idea of what it meant to be a Product Manager and my time at Google has shaped not only my career, but has also molded me into the person I am today. My wife (also a long-time Googler before she left last year) and I moved to Mountain View from San Francisco after I started working at Google and eventually bought a house not too far from the Google campus. My son was born while I was a Googler and heck, even he went to a Google day care for a brief period.  I am proud to count several of my co-workers among my closest friends. I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this company has had an immeasurable impact on my life over the past several years and I’m going to miss it greatly. 

What next? Honestly, I don’t know. I realize that I’m in a position of huge privilege to be able to make this decision without having something lined up, and I’d also be lying if I told you that the thought didn’t make me uncomfortable, but I know it’s the right thing to do. I firmly believe that when you work your way past that feeling of discomfort, true growth lies beyond it and change is the best catalyst for that. I plan to spend a lot of my time polishing my Sci-Fi novel after having received feedback from a few close friends and family who were gracious enough to read it. I have a few other writing ideas locked up in my mind that I hope to put to paper during this time. I’m also going to spend more time with my son, watch more cricket and soccer, catch up on my reading and travel to see family for the first time since COVID entered our collective vocabularies. I see the next few months as an opportunity to hit the reset button and decompress from everything we’ve had to deal with over the past couple of years. I look forward to getting out on the other side feeling refreshed, energized and excited for whatever comes next. 

But you know what this also means? I now have more free time that I totally plan on using to catch up with friends and co-workers from over the years (ping me if you want to VC or meet in person!) and also give back time mentoring (more on that later). 

Ok Google, thanks for all the memories!",1

"Sadly, on my second day at the office, I got laid off at Wayfair.
I accepted this offer 4 months ago and relocated from Amsterdam to Berlin this August after 4 months of Visa procedure. I was really excited to start the new job as I was happy with the company, position and the team. On the first day at the office, I was so warmly welcomed and everyone in the team was so nice and collaborative, nobody would have expected that things could turn into 870 people being laid off in just a day. Unfortunately, my dutch visa is now expired and I am currently on a D type German visa, so I have about 3 months to secure a new position, otherwise, I will have to move all the way back to China. 
 
I have one year experience in account management at advertising agency combined with almost 2 years’ experience in digital marketing. Since I barely know anyone in Germany, and now actively looking for a position in Berlin or Amsterdam (or remotely in the EU). Please if anyone knows any relevant openings in the field of account management or marketing roles, I would very appreciate and be pleased to discuss further.

"🎉 SOLO JUST CLOSED PRE-SEED FUNDING 🎉

Very excited to announce that the SoLo protocol raised a pre-seed round led by Entrepreneur First — to revolutionise the field of decentralised finance by providing fairer access to capital on the blockchain!

https://soulloan.io

It’s an honour to be working on the SoLo protocol making it possible for everyone to have equal access to the credit they deserve, unlike traditional credit scores which have inherent bias.

We have just released our first prototype so check it out at https://soulloan.io and see what machine learning generated credit score you receive based on your transaction data, and how much you can borrow.

Big thanks to Entrepreneur First for creating this fantastic programme and for backing us on this incredible voyage & thank you to my amazing co-founder Louis Lammerting!

"I’ve been contemplating this post because I didn’t want to come off as complaining, looking for sympathy, or seeming bitter. But I was encouraged to for myself and all of the other mama’s out there.

Recently, the best thing that has ever happened to me happened. I brought my new baby boy into the world!

I am currently on my maternity leave. Now, I was not part of my company’s previous mass layoffs, or the most recent mass layoff this past Friday. However, just a few days ago, I was told that my company’s leave policy has suddenly changed in order to save costs. I was told that this effects me directly, and my maternity leave is now suddenly and shockingly cut two months shorter than originally approved, leaving me with less than one month left of leave pay. I was also told that we are now required to be in the office 4 days a week or termination risk, regardless of an extremely long commute living in a different county from the closest office, which would leave me no time with my son.

To sum up how I feel, this is not ok. As a new mom, this is the most important time in my life and time that I should be enjoying with my baby boy, not stressing about work.

However, I want to focus on moving forward. I am so excited to say that I am officially open to new opportunities! I have been a top performing employee since starting at my current company. I put all of my energy, integrity, passion, and hard work into everything I do, and I am now ready to give this energy and more to a new opportunity. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I make a great employee, teammate, and leader!

Most importantly, my son is the most important thing in the world to me and he deserves the absolute best. I want to make him proud, and that starts with a happy mama.

The type of remote roles that I am open to, in no particular industry are: Project Manager, Customer Success, Account Manager, Coordinator, etc. I LOVE to learn new things, challenge myself, and work hard. If you are hiring, or know of any leads, please send them my way🙏.

Ps. Please also hire any of my former colleagues looking for work, you will not find more amazing people ❤️
