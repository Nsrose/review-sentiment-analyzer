The location is great, walking distance to Rainey and the river front path and the backyard is amazing (the photos don't do it justice IMO). The house was also very clean when we arrived. Preston sent some great food recs beforehand too if you're looking for any nearby (Las Trancas and Celote are great, very close by).",There is nothing negative mentioned in this review.

13,This house is perfect for a large group (bachelor/bachelorette party).  The layout is awesome for a large group as the kitchen/living room area was a perfect spot for hanging out.  The backyard is also a great space and the AirBnB description doesn't do it justice!  Plenty of room for groups of 16 or more and the location is literally a few minute walk from Rainey Street which is a huge perk.  Preston was super responsive and very helpful in terms of locking down details for our trip.,N/A

Preston also help us out with restaurant recommendations which were clutch!",N/A

29,"Where do I start?! 

We booked Preston's place for a 15 person bachelorette party weekend. Preston was very quick to respond regarding early check-in and recommendations. He was very accommodating and allowed us to check in early (with no extra charge) and provided us a long list of recommendations for the weekend. He provided us very detailed check-in/check-out guides so we were very prepared. When we checked in, we were so surprised at how nice, BEAUTIFULLY decorated, spacious, and clean the place was. There were plenty of enough beds, space, and room for all 15 of us. The backyard was one of the most used areas! 

The place had (Hidden by Airbnb) speakers with a how-to guide on how to operate so we didn't have to bring our own. Everything was sanitized and very clean. We had a question about the outdoor lights and Preston was prompt in responding. 

Highly recommend booking Preston's place for any occasion and you are sure to have a great time!

Thank you again, Preston!",N/A
30,"A great location close to Rainy street and a wonderful house, definitely recommend to any bachelor/bachelorette parties.",There is nothing negative mentioned in this review.
31,This is a very nice Air BnB that we used for a bachelor party group. We were able to have fun and still be spaced out. The projector and sound system was great for us and allowed us to have fun. Great getaway place. The kitchen design is amazing and everything opens up downstairs. Nice private backyard space,"The only negative thing mentioned in this review is that the group was ""spaced out"" due to the size of the Air BnB. Other than that, everything else about the property is positive."

34,Highly recommend for any group trip to Austin! Location is super central and easy to walk or Uber to downtown spots. The house itself is beautiful and very spacious- plenty of beds and room for everyone in our group without feeling like we were all sleeping on top of each other. The kitchen is gorgeous and very well designed. We also really loved the backyard — it’s very cute and fun to play games or hang out. Preston is super responsive and made all the logistics very easy and simple for our group. We had a wonderful time in Austin and the house itself was definitely one of the highlights.,There is nothing negative mentioned in this review.
