{"prompt":"A lot of people would look at my resume and think I'm average. I never worked at big well-known companies. I never carried big senior titles. On paper, I would get passed on for almost any senior marketing role. But the robot that scanned my resume doesn't see that I built a powerful demand gen engine from the groun dup inside a $30MM company. The middle manager skimming my resume didn't see how I'm constantly innovating to stay close to the customer. The CEO didn't see how I built two 6-figure e-commerce companies from my bedroom in my early 20s. So I stopped playing the old antiquated game built in the 1950s to be a cog in the machine. And I started playing the new game. Content marketing is the new resume\n\n###\n\n","completion":" bragging"}

{"prompt":"As I reflect on #LATechWeek last week, the perfect word to sum it up is epic. Katia Ameri, Andrew Chen, amongst hundreds of others, organized and curated such a fantastic week full of programming, content, and conversation. There were over 200 events last week, including multiple hosted by Andreessen Horowitz\n\nAs someone who grew up in SoCal and spent most of my life in LA, the entertainment industry was always synonymous with this city. This was so influential on me that I began my career in entertainment before transitioning to tech. It's not uncommon to walk through an LA hotel or restaurant and see producers, agents, and directors and overhear snippets of conversations like, \"his screenplay was just optioned by X\" or \"she's attached to Y's new project\".\n\nLast week was much different. As I walked through Santa Monica Proper Hotel and sat down for lunch at Calabra it was filled with VC's, Startup Founders, and technologists. The conversations were \"they just signed term sheets\" and \"she is joining as their Head of Eng.\"\n\nIt finally felt that Tech isn't playing second fiddle to Entertainment in LA but rather equals or counterparts. There wasn't a better way to solidify this than ending the week with a conversation with Marc Andreessen and Ari Emanuel, two leaders in their respective industries, discussing The Art of the Deal @a16z Time to Build event.\n\nI plan on sharing more frequent thoughts on Twitter.

{"prompt":"Since being laid off from Zillow, a position and Company I truly believed in (and still do), I spend every day searching for a new career.\n\nI get up every morning as if I am going to my home office to start my day of work -- because job searching is my job. I spend at least 6 to 7 hours every single day on the hunt for my new career.\n\nI am seasoned (older - there, I said it), and it is definitely affecting my chances on getting hired. Most of the people interviewing me are in their 20's (I have more years' experience, than they are old.) \n\nI've had 9 interviews with 1 Company -- got turned down. I had 7 interviews with another, got turned down. I've had many interviews that I've made through 3 & 4 interviews. I've met with recruiters (interviews were scheduled for 30 minutes in duration -- one lasted 5 minutes, another lasted 8 minutes -- couldn't get off the phone quick enough). Or I hear, I will pass your resume on to the Hiring Manager. Then nothing, I get ghosted.\n\nOr I hear nothing from my applications or thanks but no thanks within 3-5 minutes of sending in the application. \n\nI don't rely on LinkedIn, Indeed, Ziprecruiter, etc. I research companies, I've reached out to my sphere of influence, and anyone else that I can think of.\n\nI've taken classes to learn more, I comment on posts, I've had my resume professionally done (job specific), looked into other realms of business where I know I would fit in. I research companies, I research individuals that will be interviewing me to find a commonality we may have -- if not I always try and leave them with a smile on their face!\n\nI've been in the real estate industry since 1989. I've listed and sold properties, a transaction coordinator, a transaction manager, a public speaker, training new hires and new\/seasoned agents. I'm very good at what I do! I show up and I work. I'm not a clock watcher. I do my job and try and go above and beyond...to make a difference.\n\nNever in my life have I had such difficulty finding a job. I need to work, I want to work, I'm willing to work and I will show up and do just that!\n\nIf you've read this post and would like to offer \"constructive advice\", are looking for someone like me, know someone who isn't afraid to hire a \"seasoned\" individual -- please connect with me!\n\nPlease don't tell me I'm lazy -- I'm anything but that. I work every day. I deserve to be taken a chance on! I know I'm not the only one that deserves that chance...\n\nThank you, and everyone have a Great Weekend!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" humble"}
