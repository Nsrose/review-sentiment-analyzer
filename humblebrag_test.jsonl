{"prompt":"A lot of people would look at my resume and think I'm average. I never worked at big well-known companies. I never carried big senior titles. On paper, I would get passed on for almost any senior marketing role. But the robot that scanned my resume doesn't see that I built a powerful demand gen engine from the groun dup inside a $30MM company. The middle manager skimming my resume didn't see how I'm constantly innovating to stay close to the customer. The CEO didn't see how I built two 6-figure e-commerce companies from my bedroom in my early 20s. So I stopped playing the old antiquated game built in the 1950s to be a cog in the machine. And I started playing the new game. Content marketing is the new resume\n\n###\n\n","completion":" bragging"}

{"prompt":"Since being laid off from Zillow, a position and Company I truly believed in (and still do), I spend every day searching for a new career.\n\nI get up every morning as if I am going to my home office to start my day of work -- because job searching is my job. I spend at least 6 to 7 hours every single day on the hunt for my new career.\n\nI am seasoned (older - there, I said it), and it is definitely affecting my chances on getting hired. Most of the people interviewing me are in their 20's (I have more years' experience, than they are old.) \n\nI've had 9 interviews with 1 Company -- got turned down. I had 7 interviews with another, got turned down. I've had many interviews that I've made through 3 & 4 interviews. I've met with recruiters (interviews were scheduled for 30 minutes in duration -- one lasted 5 minutes, another lasted 8 minutes -- couldn't get off the phone quick enough). Or I hear, I will pass your resume on to the Hiring Manager. Then nothing, I get ghosted.\n\nOr I hear nothing from my applications or thanks but no thanks within 3-5 minutes of sending in the application. \n\nI don't rely on LinkedIn, Indeed, Ziprecruiter, etc. I research companies, I've reached out to my sphere of influence, and anyone else that I can think of.\n\nI've taken classes to learn more, I comment on posts, I've had my resume professionally done (job specific), looked into other realms of business where I know I would fit in. I research companies, I research individuals that will be interviewing me to find a commonality we may have -- if not I always try and leave them with a smile on their face!\n\nI've been in the real estate industry since 1989. I've listed and sold properties, a transaction coordinator, a transaction manager, a public speaker, training new hires and new\/seasoned agents. I'm very good at what I do! I show up and I work. I'm not a clock watcher. I do my job and try and go above and beyond...to make a difference.\n\nNever in my life have I had such difficulty finding a job. I need to work, I want to work, I'm willing to work and I will show up and do just that!\n\nIf you've read this post and would like to offer \"constructive advice\", are looking for someone like me, know someone who isn't afraid to hire a \"seasoned\" individual -- please connect with me!\n\nPlease don't tell me I'm lazy -- I'm anything but that. I work every day. I deserve to be taken a chance on! I know I'm not the only one that deserves that chance...\n\nThank you, and everyone have a Great Weekend!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" humble"}

{"prompt":"Today I graduate top 1.5% of my class at San Francisco State University with a B.S. in Business Administration; double concentration in Information Systems and Marketing as a first-generation Filipino American! \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\udded\n\nAfter transferring from City College of San Francisco of December 2019, I cannot believe my undergrad came quick!\n\nHere are a few notable things I have learned from my undergrad:\n\ud83c\udf93 Take the risk! ~ Whether it is joining an organization, striking a conversation with a person in class, or picking up a new hobby - college is too short to doubt yourself and contemplate if anything is for you. You will never be fully prepared for what is ahead, so go try it and give it your all!\n\n\ud83c\udf93 It is not all about the grade! ~ 120 units is a lot to complete. Your upper-division classes can even be more difficult. While keeping up your grades and getting that \u201cA\u201d is ideal, what matters the most is if you are learning from your classes! A grade is a grade at the end of the day, but what you take away from each class can bring even a greater difference to your career. So stay passionate and engaged in the material; ironically, the grade follows!\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Study hard, but care for yourself harder! ~ It is inevitable to have 3 exams, a 10-page paper, and a group project all due on the same day or week. While work like this can quickly become overwhelming, taking care of yourself becomes more of a priority. Your body needs rest and energy to function. Drinking water, eating a snack, taking a quick power nap or sleeping early can go a long way. We are not built to work 24\/7, so breathe! Everything will work out \u2764\ufe0f\n\nAnd just a blink of an eye, that wraps up undergrad! I hope to continue to learn and stay curious beyond education. There are more places to explore, people to meet, and lessons to be learned! So bring it! \u263a\ufe0f\ud83e\udd13\n\n__\nHere are a few notable achievements I have accomplished throughout my undergrad:\n\u2728 Marketing Department Honoree of 2022\n\u2728 Top 10 Information Systems Undergraduate of 2022\n\u2728 CIO Scholar of 2021\n\u2728 Cofounder, VP and President of Gator LinkedIn Group from 2020-2022\n\u2728 VP of Marketing of Psi Kappa, Alpha Kappa Psi of 2022\n\nSpecial thanks to my family, friends, and Professors who I have met to whom I attribute my knowledge :)\n\n#Classof2022 #Graduation #Business #SummaCumLaude #FirstGeneration #SFSUGrad #SanFranciscoStateUniversity #Marketing #InformationSystems\n\n###\n\n","completion":" bragging"}
{"prompt":"Never done this kind of post before but really need help spreading the word... Earlier this year my incredible wife Megan Colford was diagnosed with a rare blood disease that affects fewer than one in one million people, for which the only complete cure is a bone marrow transplant.\u00a0\n\nWhen we first found out, we had countless friends offer to donate their bone marrow. But unfortunately it doesn\u2019t work that way. The odds of anyone in our circle being a perfect match for Megan in particular, aside from her siblings, was very low. But the chances that those people who volunteered are a match for someone out there who needs a bone marrow transplant are much higher, and becoming a bone marrow donor means giving someone else a shot at a transplant and a second lease on life. It's a super simple process that takes only a few minutes at Be The Match - they send you a swab at home and voila you're on the registry! (https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gHMD4wdy). Alternatively, you can give blood to your local American Red Cross blood bank (you can find the one nearest to you here: https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gn4JyCxn). Megan received several life-saving blood transfusions in the lead-up to the transplant, and will receive more as she continues to recover.\n\nAfter a successful transplant and 30 days in the hospital, we headed home today. We were lucky that her brother was a perfect match, but for most people BeTheMatch is their only hope.
