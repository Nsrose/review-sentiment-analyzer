{"prompt":"Our Fact #30 for #FactFriday - intracranial pressure (ICP)\nFor many diseases of the brain, it is necessary to measure the pressure inside the skull. This pressure is called intracranial pressure (ICP). Broadly speaking, there are three components inside the skull: Brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid and vessels\/blood. If the volume of one of these components increases, the ICP will change. This is the case in acute hydrocephalus, but also tumors and brain haemorrhages can disrupt the balance between the three components and result in an increased ICP. ICP is currently measured with different invasive systems, each with their own characteristics and challenges. The measurement of ICP is in itself only a monitoring-tool, which, if necessary, has to be combined with ICP regulating measures.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" humble"}

{"prompt":"As I reflect on #LATechWeek last week, the perfect word to sum it up is epic. Katia Ameri, Andrew Chen, amongst hundreds of others, organized and curated such a fantastic week full of programming, content, and conversation. There were over 200 events last week, including multiple hosted by Andreessen Horowitz\n\nAs someone who grew up in SoCal and spent most of my life in LA, the entertainment industry was always synonymous with this city. This was so influential on me that I began my career in entertainment before transitioning to tech. It's not uncommon to walk through an LA hotel or restaurant and see producers, agents, and directors and overhear snippets of conversations like, \"his screenplay was just optioned by X\" or \"she's attached to Y's new project\".\n\nLast week was much different. As I walked through Santa Monica Proper Hotel and sat down for lunch at Calabra it was filled with VC's, Startup Founders, and technologists. The conversations were \"they just signed term sheets\" and \"she is joining as their Head of Eng.\"\n\nIt finally felt that Tech isn't playing second fiddle to Entertainment in LA but rather equals or counterparts. There wasn't a better way to solidify this than ending the week with a conversation with Marc Andreessen and Ari Emanuel, two leaders in their respective industries, discussing The Art of the Deal @a16z Time to Build event.\n\nI plan on sharing more frequent thoughts on Twitter.

{"prompt":"I\u2019ll rip the band-aid right off: I just left #Google! As with any big decision, this is something I've pondered over a period of time and as I\u2019ve seen several people join the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d over the past couple of years, I always felt a slight tinge of envy, but never realized that when I did the same, it would bring so many emotions to the surface. I dropped off my badge and laptop just an hour ago (obligatory pic attached) and that was the moment when it felt real. Almost too real.\u00a0\n\nI feel immense pride at having built the things I helped build and also a lifetime of gratitude for having had the opportunity to learn from the best and brightest people on the planet, but talking about my Google experience via the work I did would be like describing an iceberg by its tip. I joined over 9 years ago with a faint idea of what it meant to be a Product Manager and my time at Google has shaped not only my career, but has also molded me into the person I am today. My wife (also a long-time Googler before she left last year) and I moved to Mountain View from San Francisco after I started working at Google and eventually bought a house not too far from the Google campus. My son was born while I was a Googler and heck, even he went to a Google day care for a brief period.\u00a0 I am proud to count several of my co-workers among my closest friends. I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this company has had an immeasurable impact on my life over the past several years and I\u2019m going to miss it greatly.\u00a0\n\nWhat next? Honestly, I don\u2019t know. I realize that I\u2019m in a position of huge privilege to be able to make this decision without having something lined up, and I\u2019d also be lying if I told you that the thought didn\u2019t make me uncomfortable, but I know it\u2019s the right thing to do. I firmly believe that when you work your way past that feeling of discomfort, true growth lies beyond it and change is the best catalyst for that. I plan to spend a lot of my time polishing my Sci-Fi novel after having received feedback from a few close friends and family who were gracious enough to read it. I have a few other writing ideas locked up in my mind that I hope to put to paper during this time. I\u2019m also going to spend more time with my son, watch more cricket and soccer, catch up on my reading and travel to see family for the first time since COVID entered our collective vocabularies. I see the next few months as an opportunity to hit the reset button and decompress from everything we\u2019ve had to deal with over the past couple of years. I look forward to getting out on the other side feeling refreshed, energized and excited for whatever comes next.\u00a0\n\nBut you know what this also means? I now have more free time that I totally plan on using to catch up with friends and co-workers from over the years (ping me if you want to VC or meet in person!) and also give back time mentoring (more on that later).\u00a0\n\nOk Google, thanks for all the memories!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" bragging"}
