"Sadly, on my second day at the office, I got laid off at Wayfair.I accepted this offer 4 months ago and relocated from Amsterdam to Berlin this August after 4 months of Visa procedure.

On the first day at the office, I was so warmly welcomed and everyone in the team was so nice and collaborative, nobody would have expected that things could turn into 870 people being laid off in just a day. Unfortunately, my dutch visa is now expired and I am currently on a D type German visa, so I have about 3 months to secure a new position, otherwise, I will have to move all the way back to China.

"A lot of people would look at my resume and think I'm average. I never worked at big well-known companies. I never carried big senior titles. On paper, I would get passed on for almost any senior marketing role. But the robot that scanned my resume doesn't see that I built a powerful demand gen engine from the groun dup inside a $30MM company. The middle manager skimming my resume didn't see how I'm constantly innovating to stay close to the customer. The CEO didn't see how I built two 6-figure e-commerce companies from my bedroom in my early 20s. So I stopped playing the old antiquated game built in the 1950s to be a cog in the machine.

"As I reflect on #LATechWeek last week, the perfect word to sum it up is epic. Katia Ameri, Andrew Chen, amongst hundreds of others, organized and curated such a fantastic week full of programming, content, and conversation. There were over 200 events last week, including multiple hosted by Andreessen Horowitz

As someone who grew up in SoCal and spent most of my life in LA, the entertainment industry was always synonymous with this city. This was so influential on me that I began my career in entertainment before transitioning to tech. It's not uncommon to walk through an LA hotel or restaurant and see producers, agents, and directors and overhear snippets of conversations like, ""his screenplay was just optioned by X"" or ""she's attached to Y's new project"".

Last week was much different. As I walked through Santa Monica Proper Hotel and sat down for lunch at Calabra it was filled with VC's, Startup Founders, and technologists. The conversations were ""they just signed term sheets"" and ""she is joining as their Head of Eng.""

It finally felt that Tech isn't playing second fiddle to Entertainment in LA but rather equals or counterparts. There wasn't a better way to solidify this than ending the week with a conversation with Marc Andreessen and Ari Emanuel, two leaders in their respective industries, discussing The Art of the Deal @a16z Time to Build event.

"You have your list of keywords. How do you prioritize?

Try the opportunity score.

Here's how it worksüëá

Average volume X CPC / Difficulty =

I'll break it down below:

‚úÖ Average volume. I use at least 2 tools (usually Ahrefs & Keywords Everywhere). I'll run a report on both of them, dump them in a spreadsheet, and then calculate the average volume.

‚úÖ CPC. Why this metric? It's imperfect, but it shows how the market values the keyword. It's a signal that this word is important, and potentially that people are ready to buy.

*NOTE: Just because everyone else values the keyword doesn't mean you should as well. Use your best judgment for your ICP, pain points, and core feature set. I don't think content people look at this metric enough, but don't overdo it.

‚úÖ Difficulty. This is (again) imperfect, but I pull this number from Ahrefs. It gives me a rough estimate of how hard it will be to rank for this word.

After this, you'll have a list of words ranked by the opportunity score.

Not every word will be a fit for your customer.

Not every word will fit your timeline or funnel.

It's another tool to use when you need it.

‚≠êÔ∏è High opportunity score = the keywords you should consider first",0

"Since being laid off from Zillow, a position and Company I truly believed in (and still do), I spend every day searching for a new career.

I get up every morning as if I am going to my home office to start my day of work -- because job searching is my job. I spend at least 6 to 7 hours every single day on the hunt for my new career.

I am seasoned (older - there, I said it), and it is definitely affecting my chances on getting hired. Most of the people interviewing me are in their 20's (I have more years' experience, than they are old.) 

I've had 9 interviews with 1 Company -- got turned down. I had 7 interviews with another, got turned down. I've had many interviews that I've made through 3 & 4 interviews. I've met with recruiters (interviews were scheduled for 30 minutes in duration -- one lasted 5 minutes, another lasted 8 minutes -- couldn't get off the phone quick enough). Or I hear, I will pass your resume on to the Hiring Manager. Then nothing, I get ghosted.

Or I hear nothing from my applications or thanks but no thanks within 3-5 minutes of sending in the application. 

I don't rely on LinkedIn, Indeed, Ziprecruiter, etc. I research companies, I've reached out to my sphere of influence, and anyone else that I can think of.

I've taken classes to learn more, I comment on posts, I've had my resume professionally done (job specific), looked into other realms of business where I know I would fit in. I research companies, I research individuals that will be interviewing me to find a commonality we may have -- if not I always try and leave them with a smile on their face!

I've been in the real estate industry since 1989. I've listed and sold properties, a transaction coordinator, a transaction manager, a public speaker, training new hires and new/seasoned agents. I'm very good at what I do! I show up and I work. I'm not a clock watcher. I do my job and try and go above and beyond...to make a difference.

Never in my life have I had such difficulty finding a job. I need to work, I want to work, I'm willing to work and I will show up and do just that!

If you've read this post and would like to offer ""constructive advice"", are looking for someone like me, know someone who isn't afraid to hire a ""seasoned"" individual -- please connect with me!

Please don't tell me I'm lazy -- I'm anything but that. I work every day. I deserve to be taken a chance on! I know I'm not the only one that deserves that chance...

Thank you, and everyone have a Great Weekend!",0

"Thank you The New York Times for this great piece on the realities behind the adolescent #mentalhealth crisis and how we got here.

It summarizes so many of the findings that led me to start üíõ Clayful  and why we're flipping the existing systems on their head:

‚úãthere‚Äôs not enough trained providers to support adolescents 
üëâ so we‚Äôre training a new workforce and giving them the tools + knowledge necessary to triage and support pre-clinical needs",1
"465 days ago, I took a huge leap. I knew that I was scared. I knew that it was risky. I knew that I could be making a costly mistake. More importantly, however, I knew that I could not continue doing the same thing that I had been doing and needed to take a huge leap of faith - in myself.

Today, I look back at the past 365 days (and my Noogler hat) and feel gratitude for every single moment that brought to this day - my ONE YEAR GOOGLEVERSARY. I am inspired by the brilliance and the ingenuity that surrounds me every day. I am motivated by the numerous opportunities to grow, to learn and to lead. Most of all, I am looking forward to seeing where this journey takes me and many more Googleversaries to come.",1

"Work life balance, or work life integration means different things to different people. Give your team members the flexibility to do what works best for them!

For example, an employee leaves early a few hours on a Friday, but checks a few emails during their vacation week. There‚Äôs no prescribed way to calculate what makes it ‚Äúequal‚Äù.

Wait‚Ä¶I‚Äôm looking at the article title. Should we expect work during vacation time? Absolutely not! It needs to be an intentional, personal choice that you are comfortable with.

It‚Äôs up to you to decide how to detach and which boundaries work best for you. The key is to understand if the decisions you‚Äôve made were intentional (ex. Check emails 1 hour/day before 9am) or unintentional (ex. Unlimited pings to respond to).

Give yourself and others the grace, and don‚Äôt feel guilty either way!",0

"Today is my 1st Metaversary!!! ü•≥

In the last year, I have...
- Worked completely remotely and have successfully balanced work and life
- Worked with an amazing team of highly skilled sourcers and recruiters
- Hired many incredible Metamates to the organization!
- Had direct facetime with my Recruiting Director, Recruiting Manager and Recruiting Lead.
- Got to play in the metaverse!! I'm holding on tight to my Beat Saber high scores!
- Made some phenomenal connections through extra curricular projects and events around personal/professional growth and DEI
- Felt empowered to speak my mind, share my ideas, and exist authentically
- Overcame challenges and learned to thrive with adaptability in a whole new recruiting space in a job market that is unlike ever before. Sometimes it was hard, sometimes it was easy, but it was always fun.

Time truly does fly when you're having fun! Thank you Meta for giving me the space to help candidates navigate the hiring process. Connecting with job seekers is such a passion for me. I can't wait to see what the future holds!",1

"After a year of a whirl wind ride growing Ironclad from 200 to over 500 Cladiators strong, it‚Äôs with massive gratitude that I close this chapter, at least for now. I‚Äôve been offered an opportunity to focus my career on an area that I‚Äôve always wanted to grow in and knew I‚Äôd regret if I didn‚Äôt make the leap.

Thank you for the incredible year of growth, in more ways than one!

It‚Äôs not goodbye, it‚Äôs only see you later; no doubt I‚Äôll be rooting for Ironclad and this awesome team with the mission to **power the world‚Äôs contracts!!!**

As for my next chapter, more to come on that soon!",1
"Last week, I had the opportunity to visit and work from the Google office in Singapore!

The Google Play Trust and Safety team hosted an incredible offsite event that allowed us to meet and network in person for the first time. As a 3-week Noogler, I'm extremely appreciative to the entire team and my leadership for welcoming me so warmly.

My first business trip was definitely one for the books!",1
